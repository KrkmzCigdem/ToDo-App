# ToDo-App

Local storage is a feature in web browsers that enables web applications to store key-value pairs directly in the user's browser, allowing data to be saved during one session and accessed in future sessions.

In this TODO application, you'll learn how to manage form inputs, use local storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, set up event listeners, and control UI elements effectively.
